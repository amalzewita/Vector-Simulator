# 2D Vector Forces Simulator

A browser-based educational simulator for visualizing 2D vector addition using the **Triangle Method** and **Parallelogram Method**. This interactive tool allows students and educators to experiment with up to 3 vectors and observe the resultant vector dynamically.

## 🌐 Live Demo

> Coming soon — deploy this project using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## 📸 Features

- 🎯 Real-time vector visualization on a 2D canvas
- 🔁 Switch between Triangle and Parallelogram methods
- 🎮 Drag vector tips to update magnitude and direction interactively
- 📊 Resultant vector with computed magnitude and angle
- ✨ Supports 2 or 3 vector combinations
- 📱 Responsive and modern UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Chart.js)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for vector plotting
- [Chart.js Annotation Plugin](https://www.chartjs.org/chartjs-plugin-annotation/latest/) for axis lines
